## SSL 
*SSL Secure Socket Layer*
---
* It is a security protocol used to establish an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser.
- ensures that the data transmitted between the server and the browser remains private and secure.
+ SSL works through a process called encryption. Encryption converts the data into a code that can only be understood by the intended recipient, which is the Web Server.

** What happens when you connect to a website using SSL **
1. The web server sends its SSL certificate to your browser.__The certificate contains a public key, which is used to encrypt the data.__
2. The browser checks the SSL certificate to ensure it is valid and issued by a trusted authority. It also verifies that the website's domain matches the information in the certificate.
